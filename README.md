Ladies and Gentlemen,

welcome to my Read me. I am Bardia and fairly new to GitHub. This account was created to help my team and I to organize an ongoing web application
project and I am glad to be a part of the GitHub community!

As for myself, I am currently 21 years old and started programming a year before I enrolled into university. I have actually liked the tech area since I was a
little kid, but never actually started with it until I watched a movie; I unfortunately can't recall the name ðŸ˜¥. Anyway, it blew me away storytelling wise 
and has given me a new perspective in that field, which motivated to get into it. A decision I definetly don't regret ðŸ˜„.

I love calisthenics and playing table tennis. Actually thinking about it, I like pretty much a lot of stuff that puts me out of my comfort zone and pushes me to new heights both physically and mentally speaking. Speaking of putting myself out of the comfort zone, I love competition, especially in areas you are really passionate about. Recently participated in a programming competition, in which we got questions about datastructures and algorithms. 
I miserably failed, but at least it was fun ðŸ˜†.  

On the last parapgraph I scratched over my hobbies and personal strengths, but I obviously have, like everyone else,weaknesses. Unlike other people,who complain endlessly about how unfair certain things can be in life, I am willing to put my time and effort to improve upon my weaknesses and hopefully learn from it. Trust me, complainig over things you can't change is a waste of time and I had to learn it the hard way.

As for my future, I am not quite sure yet, in which field I wan't to work for once I graduate from university. There are plenty of fields, that I am interested in!
A few examples are software engineering, AI and Cryptography. Time will only tell. 

That is it for me now. Defintely not the best Read me, but I hope you were able to get a rough overview about me. ðŸ™‚

Yours truly

Bardia
