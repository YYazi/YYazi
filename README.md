Ladies and Gentlemen,

welcome to my Read me. I am Bardia and fairly new to GitHub. This account was created to help my team and I to organize an ongoing web application
project and I am glad to be a part of the GitHub community!

As for myself, I am currently 21 years old and started programming a year before I enrolled into university. I have actually liked the tech area since I was a
little kid, but never actually started with it until I watched a movie; I unfortunately can't recall the name ðŸ˜¥. Anyway, it blew me away storytelling wise 
and has given me a new perspective in that field, which motivated to get into it. A decision I definetly don't regret ðŸ˜„.

I love doing calisthenics and playing table tennis. Actually thinking about it, I like pretty much a lot of stuff that puts me out of my comfort zone and pushes me to new 
heights both physically and mentally speaking, as long as I enjoy doing it obviously. Speaking of putting myself out of the comfort zone, I love competition, especially in areas you are really passionate about. Recently participated in a programming competition, in which we got questions about datastructures and algorithms. 
I miserably failed, but hey at least it was fun ðŸ˜†.  

From the last paragraph you might now think, that I sound like I am perfect, but you couldn't be further from the truth. I do have weaknesses and I am willing 
to put my time and effort to improve upon it and hopefully learn from my past mistakes.

As for my future, I am not quite sure yet, in which field I wan't to work for once I graduate from university. There are plenty of fields, that I am interested in!
A few examples are software engineering, AI and Cryptography. Time will only tell. 

That is it for me now. Defintely not the best Read me, but I hope you were able to get a rough overview about me. ðŸ™‚

Yours truly

Bardia
